# $name  SSL Patch
# $desc  Patches the SSL module to disable Root CA Verification. May be a security hazard. More info in github.com/SciresM/3DS-SSL-Patch.
# $title 0004013000002F02
# $ver   01
# $uuid  0008

# This patch was originally implemented by SciresM and I really
# haven't given it the testing needed.

# Having this enabled will make it so that anyone can steal your 3ds's private information over the network 
# Because it makes all of your SSL requests insecure.

# You may also need to send CLCertA as a client certificate. Unclear on that.
# More information about it on github.com/SciresM/3DS-SSL-Patch
