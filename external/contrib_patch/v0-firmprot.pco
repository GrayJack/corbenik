# This patch was originally implemented by SciresM and I really
# haven't given it the testing needed.

# This patch is O3DS only, since the Factory firm of the New 3DS is identical to
# the 8.1 New 3DS FIRM so the usual FIRM protection will work.

# This is also identical to the safemode patch for FIRM protection
# if you're astute. Corbenik doesn't support that, though.
